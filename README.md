Invisible Registry Key Management Utility

This can create, edit, delete, and query invisible registry keys. Query only works if you already know the key name beforehand, I have yet to implement a registry wide scanner of invisible keys. See the TODO section.

This tool was made to be used in penetration testing engagements, I'm not responsible for how you use this.

The code isn't beautiful yet, and there is a lot to be done. I intend on improving this tool as I use it and come across more interesting use cases for invisible registry keys.
